The goal of this assignment is to build a cinema theatre ticket booking app with the following specifications -

1. You are tasked with building an app which will help a user select seats in a cinema theatre and display a time-limited summary of their selected seats.
2. You have a list of seats with x rows & y columns, with these conditions - 
     • Any of the seats can be marked as already booked to avoid two people booking the same seats.
    . Any of the seats can be marked disabled. This is important to customise the seating arrangement to match the exact arrangement of the cinema theatre.
    . Each row of seats will have their own price.
3. Once the user has selected their seats, they can navigate to the next page where they will be shown a summary of the seats they chose and the total price, along with a countdown timer of a configurable number of minutes (default to 5). If they navigate back, the previously selected seats should be shown. Once the countdown has completed, if they navigate back, the selected seats should be cleared.
4. The React component should be built in a way that every cinema theatre can customise the layout and row prices.
5. Technology stack
React 17.
• TypeScript (optional, in case you only know JavaScript).
Recommended libraries
☐ These aren't mandatory, but we recommend these because we like and use them at yogya.ai.
• If there's a need for state, prefer very lightweight state management tools like zustand or jotai over heavy ones like Redux, MobX, etc.
• Any Ul/component libraries like Tailwind, & Material UI, etc. These can help you speed up UI development.
☐ Bonus points
• Correct use of React hooks.
